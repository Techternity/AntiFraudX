## Team Name and Hackathon
**Team Name**: Techternity  
**Hackathon**: Hack4Bengal 4.0

## Acknowledgement
We extend our gratitude to the Hack4Bengal 4.0 organizers for providing this platform to showcase our innovation. Special thanks to Major League Hacking (MLH) for the MongoDB Atlas track, our mentors for their guidance, and our team for their relentless dedication. We also appreciate MongoDB for the student credits that powered our project.

## Introduction
AntiFraudX is a real-time financial fraud prevention system designed to protect banks and account holders. By generating Trust Scores based on transaction patterns, locations, and user behavior, it instantly detects and mitigates fraud. Integrated with MongoDB Atlas, AntiFraudX uses rule-based transaction monitoring to flag suspicious activities like unusual amounts or high-frequency transactions, ensuring proactive fraud prevention. Our solution aligns with the MLH Best Use of MongoDB Atlas track, leveraging its scalability and low-latency for real-time analytics.
